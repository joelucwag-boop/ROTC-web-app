app.integrations package initializer.

This file marks the integrations directory as a Python package so it can be
imported using `from app.integrations import ...`.

Keep all external-data interfaces here (Google Sheets, APIs, etc.)
so they donâ€™t clutter the main app logic.

# You can also put any global constants or helper imports here later if needed.
